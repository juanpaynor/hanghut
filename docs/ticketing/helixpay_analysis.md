| **Subscription Mgmt** | 5% revenue share + payment processing (1.5-3%) |
| **No Upfront Costs** | Free to start |
| **Payment Processing** | 1.5-3% (passed to merchant) |

### HangHut Pricing (Recommended)

**Option 1: Percentage-Based (simpler)**
```
10% platform fee (HangHut)
+ Payment processing (Xendit 2.9% + ₱15)

Example (500 tickets @ ₱500):
Gross: ₱250,000
HangHut: ₱25,000 (10%)
Xendit: ~₱14,750
Organizer: ₱210,250 (84%)
```

Xendit: ~₱14,750
Organizer: ₱217,750 (87%)
```

**Option 3: Tiered (best for growth)**
```
Tier 1 (small): 15% (₱0-10k sales) - easy to start
Tier 2 (medium): 10% (₱10k-100k sales) - competitive
Tier 3 (large): 7% (₱100k+ sales) - retain big organizers
+ Payment processing
```

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option 1 (10% flat)** - simplest to communicate, competitive vs HelixPay's ₱20/ticket (~4%).

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Positioning Statement

**For** community organizers and social event-goers  
**Who** want to discover and attend local events  
**HangHut** is a mobile-first social platform  
**That** combines ticketing with friend networks and map-based discovery  
**Unlike** HelixPay which focuses on large-scale professional events  
**We** make it easy to find, share, and attend events with your community

### Target Segments (Avoid HelixPay's sweet spot)

**Primary:**
1. Small event organizers (20-200 people)
2. Community groups (running clubs, gaming)
3. Local businesses (restaurant takeovers, pop-ups)
4. Content creators (workshops, meetups)

**Secondary:**
1. Friend groups organizing outings
2. Hobby communities
3. University student orgs

**Avoid (HelixPay territory):**
- Major concerts (1000+ people)
- Corporate conferences
- Sports stadiums
- Festival promoters

---

## Win Conditions

**Short-term (6 months):**
- 100+ events posted
- 50% have <100 attendees (proving niche)
- 30% repeat organizers
- 4.5+ star rating

**Medium-term (12 months):**
- 500+ events posted
- 40% of tickets sold through social referrals
- 10,000+ active users
- Break-even on operations

**Long-term (24 months):**
- Default platform for community events in Metro Manila
- HelixPay still focused on large events (avoided competition)
- Geographic expansion (Cebu, Davao)

---

## Final Verdict

**Can HangHut compete with HelixPay?**

✅ **YES - if you stay in your lane**

**Your moat:**
- Social features (they won't build)
- Mobile-native (you're faster)
- Map discovery (unique value prop)
- Community focus (they target enterprises)

**Don't compete on:**
- Large event features
- Enterprise tools
- On-site services

**The market is big enough for both:**
- HelixPay: Professional events (₱500M+ TAM)
- HangHut: Community events (₱300M+ TAM)

**Key insight:** You're not actually competitors - you serve different markets that happen to both use "ticketing". Your real innovation is **social discovery**, not ticketing technology.

## Action Items

- [ ] Finalize 10% flat fee pricing
- [ ] Build ticketing MVP (no custom websites, no seat maps)
- [ ] Emphasize map + social in all marketing
- [ ] Target small businesses for pilot (20-50 person events)
